Implement lexer for selected programming language. Store tokens in a special table. Display structured lexical information after processing. Make sure to detect and indicate lexical errors in the input. To accomplish this a specialized error “token” could be introduced.

Note: at least part of the tokens should be recognized using FA technique. 

Following “tokens” should be considered:
- numeric constants
- literals and symbolic constants
-	preprocessor directives
-	comments
-	keywords
-	identifiers
-	operators
-	punctuation marks

Options for output:
-	sequence of tokens
-	source code highlighting
-	tokens sorted by type
